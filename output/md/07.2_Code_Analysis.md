## 10. Exercise #8: Assembly

- Ask an LLM what this assembly does.
- Ask an LLM for the user input that would cause this program to print "Good Job."

## 11. -

- Based on your analysis, was the LLM correct in the previous step?
- Is it able to give a correct answer?
- How might you help a large language model successfully reverse engineer this level?

## 14. -

- How does the decompiled function compare to the AsciiStrCmp function found in Exercise #9?

## 20. Exercise #6: Python deobfuscation

- Explore whether an LLM is able to produce a decrypted string automatically.
- If not, explore whether an LLM can provide appropriate code for doing so
- With the help of an LLM, identify the function of this code
- With the help of an LLM, identify the function of this code and deobfuscate it to generate its original form.

## 21. -

- Using manual analysis, what does the code do? Is it malicious?
- Ask an LLM to answer the same questions. Is it accurate based on your reading of the code?
- Does the LLM change its assessment?

## 22. -

- What tasks was it able to perform accurately?
- What tasks was it unable to perform accurately?
- What is the flag?

## 23. Exercise #7: C deobfuscation

- What does it believe the output of this program is?
- What is the actual output of the program?
