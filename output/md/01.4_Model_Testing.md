# 01.4: Model Testing

## 1. Model introspection

- Include a table that shows the answers returned for each LLM for each characteristic for your lab notebook.

## 2. Retrieval capabilities

- Include a table that shows the answers returned for each LLM for the prompt used in each category for your lab notebook.

## 3. Generation

- Describe and show qualitative differences between the models for each prompt
- Take a screenshot including your OdinID of the results for your lab notebook
- For each LLM, take a screenshot including your OdinID of the results of guardrails being applied to suppress output for your lab notebook
- For each LLM, take a screenshot including your OdinID of the results of the most effective bypass for each LLM for your lab notebook

## 4. Summarization

- Show the output and describe any differences between them
- Show the output and describe the differences between them
- Compare the outputs produced

## 5. Information extraction

- Show the results and describe the differences between them

## 6. Classification

- Show the results of the classification
- Show the results of the classification

## 7. -

- Examine the performance of an LLM on this task
- Examine the improved effectiveness (if any) of the LLM compared to the zero-shot example

## 8. Reasoning

- Show how the output differs when given to an LLM
- Show the effectiveness of the different prompt strategies on the output of an LLM

## 9. -

- Show the results from each LLM and compare the accuracy of each in solving each task.
